## Bomb Em' Game!
- Inspired by [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_GB), this game allows you to play as a "Guy" roaming around and kill monsters, thus venture deeply into the dungeon deeper and deeper below...
- Fully programmed on Java in Android Studio.
- You can download and play the game yourself [**here**](https://github.com/huan161299/Bomb-Em-Game/blob/master/bomb'em.apk).
